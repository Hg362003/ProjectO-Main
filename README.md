# ProjectO-Main

ProjectO is a real-time collaboration platform that connects developers, students, and creators to build projects together. It combines social networking with AI-driven role matching to make finding teammates and working together seamless.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/database?appName=ProjectO"

NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```
